crankshaftd
===========

Simple Go agent to ingest streaming data from Turbine via SSE and push it into
StatsD as a gauge or to StackDriver as a series.

## Property Munging

All keys related to properties (such as max threadpool size, queue lengths,
etc.) are stripped by default.

Properties of the following patterns are kept:

- current*
- rollingCount*
- latencyTotal_*
- isCircuitBreakerOpen

Normal keys are pushed under `my-prefix.my-cluster.MyCommandImpl.rollingCountSuccess`

Latency histograms are pushed under `my-prefix.my-cluster.MyCommandImpl.latencyTotal.xx_pct`

isCircuitBreakerOpen will be either 0 or 1.

## StatsD caveat

All metric values are cast from float64 -> int64. The InfluxDB backend does not
have this limitation.

## Running

Create a config.toml with your config

```toml
# Turbine connection information
host = "turbine.yourcompany.com"
path = "/"
port = 80
tls_enabled = false
clusters = ["cluster1", "cluster2"]

# Backend to stream updates to, 'statsd' or 'stackdriver'
backendtype = "stackdriver"

[statsd]
host = "127.0.0.1"
port = 8125
prefix = "hystrix"

[stackdriver]
api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"
```

Build the project

    go build

And deploy the resulting binary & config

    ./crankshaftd

Or run with a different config

    ./crankshaftd dev.toml
